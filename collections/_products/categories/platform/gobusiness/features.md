### User-friendly website with consolidated information
The GoBusiness website consolidates business information from across 30 government agencies and arranges them according to business stages for easy navigation. This makes it intuitive and easy for users to find the relevant information without needing to search through multiple websites or reach out to different government agencies separately. 

### Step-by-step guidance for new businesses
The start-up guide on GoBusiness gives new and aspiring entrepreneurs an overview of the regulatory processes of starting a business in Singapore. These include information on choosing a business structure, reserving a business name and incorporating a business.  The guide breaks down the processes into six clear steps that users can easily follow to start off their business on the right foot.  

### Personalised dashboard for simplified transactions
The dashboard gives users an overview of their transactions with the Government, and allows them to seamlessly apply, renew, and amend licences, as well as register a sole-proprietorship or partnership business. More than 200 licences can be accessed via the dashboard; users can also easily keep track of the status of their applications on the dashboard and be prompted if any action is required. In addition, users can receive a range of licence and grant recommendations tailored to their unique business profiles on the dashboard.

### e-Advisers to provide personalised recommendations
Users can access various e-Advisers available on GoBusiness to receive recommendations on business structures, government assistance schemes, premises use and more. Users will be directed to relevant information, government assistance schemes and licences suitable for their business needs just by answering short questionnaires on the e-Advisers.
